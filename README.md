# Estimation-of-Ground-Water-Levels-using-Geophysical-Survey-Data-using-ML-and-xAl
This project aims to estimate groundwater levels using soil properties obtained from geophysical surveys with the help of machine learning models (XGBoost Classifier in this case) explainable AI (xAI, SHAP in particular) to further understand the impact of various soil properties on the final outcome (which is a 2D subsurface visualization).
